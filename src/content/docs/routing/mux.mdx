The most basic router is the `mux` router in the form of `pattern: handler`, which is a simple key-value pair.
The key matches `host/path` and the value is the handler to call, which can also be another mux if it is a sequence.

Note that any virtual host aliases that are defined at the virtual host level are resolved into the first variant.

## Prefix Matching (`/` & `+`)

The prefix matcher can come in two forms: `foo/` and `foo+`.
The former matches the prefix exactly, including the trailing slash, while the latter matches the prefix and any string that follows.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - site.com/foo/: bar
    - site.com/foo+: foo
```

| Path             | Handler |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| site.com/foo/    | bar     |
| site.local/foo/  | bar     |
| site.com/foo/bar | bar     |
| site.com/foo     | foo     |
| site.com/foobar  | foo     |

## Suffix Matching (`+`)

The suffix matcher is similarly in the form of `+foo` and matching the suffix exactly, without the plus sign.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - +.map: abort
```

| Path           | Handler |
| -------------- | ------- |
| site.com/a     | -       |
| site.com/a.map | abort   |

## Regex Matching (`~`)

The above examples are fast and efficient, but sometimes you need more complex matching. This is where the regex matcher comes in, in the form of `~pattern`.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - ~/\d\d.json$: status 404
```

| Path              | Handler    |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| site.com/12.json  | status 404 |
| site.com/123.json | -          |
| site.com/12.json5 | -          |

## Exact Matching

Anything that doesn't match the above patterns is treated as an exact match.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - site.com/foo: foo
    - site.com/bar: bar
```

| Path            | Handler |
| --------------- | ------- |
| site.com/foo    | foo     |
| site.com/bar    | bar     |
| site.com/foobar | -       |

## Multiple Matchers (`, `)

You can also combine multiple matchers using the or operator `, ` (mind the space).

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - site.com/foo, site.com/bar: foobar
```

| Path            | Handler |
| --------------- | ------- |
| site.com/foo    | foobar  |
| site.com/bar    | foobar  |
| site.com/foobar | -       |
