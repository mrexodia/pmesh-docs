Rate limiting is a mechanism to control the number of requests that a client can make to an API within a given time frame.
This is useful to prevent abuse and to ensure that the API is available to all clients.

## Configuration

Configuration of a rate limiter can be done either in the short-hand string format or in the long-hand object format.
For exploring each field, let's consider the configuration in the long-hand object format.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - api.site.com/:
        - !Limit
          id: "api"
          rate: 10/s
          burst: 100
          block_after: 100/s
          block_for: 1m
          advise: true
        - api
```

### id

- Type: `string?`
- Default: `none`

An optional identifier for the rate limiter, which is used to bucket the request into a specific group.

### rate

- Type: `rate`
- Default: `none`

The rate at which requests are allowed. The rate is specified as a number of requests per second, minute, hour, or day.

For example:

- `10/s` - 10 requests per second
- `1m` - 1 request per minute

### burst

- Type: `int?`
- Default: `none`

The maximum burst size. This is the maximum number of requests that can be made in a single burst, which is useful for handling short-term spikes in traffic.

### block_after

- Type: `rate?`
- Default: `none`

The rate at which the client should be blocked after making excessive requests. This is useful for skipping the queue immediately when the client is obviously malicious.

### block_for

- Type: `duration?`
- Default: `none`

The duration for which the client should be blocked. This is the duration for which the client is banned website wide after reading the `block_after` rate.

### advise

- Type: `bool?`
- Default: `false`

Whether to advise the client on the block duration. This is useful for informing the client about the block duration, so that they can adjust their behavior accordingly.
If `true`, the client will receive a `Retry-After` header with the information required. This can be useful if you are serving an API and you want the implementation to be
aware of the rate limit.

## Short-hand format

The short-hand format is a string that represents the rate limiter configuration in a single line. The format is as follows:

- If the rate limiter starts with `@`, then the value after `@` is the `id` of the rate limiter.
- After that is the `rate` of the rate limiter.
- If the rate limiter has a `burst` value, then it is specified as `burst=<value>`.
- If the rate limiter has a `block_after` value, then it is specified as `block_after=<rate>`.
- If the rate limiter has a `block_for` value, then it is specified as `block_for=<duration>`.
- If the rate limiter has an `advise` value, then it is specified as `advise=<bool>`.

For example, the limit above can be represented in the short-hand format as follows:

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - api.site.com/:
        - limit @api 10/s burst=100 block_after=100/s block_for=1m advise=1
        - api
```
